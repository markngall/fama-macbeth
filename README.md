# fama-macbeth
Testing asset pricing models using the Fama-MacBeth methodology.

Part of a project for the Asset Pricing & Risk module at the University of Warwick (MSc Mathematical Finance).

Considered three models:
- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
- Fama-French Three Factor Model
- A new Four Factor Model

The Four Factor Model adds unemployment to the standard Fama-French factors. One of the goals of this project was to investigate whether unemployment rate is predictive of returns.

The data was obtained from the French data library (https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html). The US unemployment rate data was obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. A 20-year time period was considered (01/00-10/20).
